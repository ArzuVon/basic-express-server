# Node Ecosystem, TDD, CI/CD

Application development in the Node.js ecosystem, including the writing of modular code using CommonJS modules, writing tests to assert code quality, setting up and working in a "Continuous Integration"  environment (Github Actions).

- Node and the V8 Engine

#### Execute

- Setup a Node.js Package using npm
- Create CommonJS modules
- Create a simple express server
- See passing tests via GitHub actions (CI)
- Deploy to Heroku using CD

### CI/CD - Continuous Integration and Deployment

In your lab today, you'll be doing a full "professional" deployment using 2 branches, PR's, and a continuous process to get your code deployed.

You will repeat this process for every server based lab moving forward. Keep these notes (and the lab steps) handy for future reference
